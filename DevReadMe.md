TideCloak developer playground 🚀

A secure, privacy-first identity and data management sandbox built with TideCloak. This repo demonstrates key functionality of TideCloak through interactive examples and self-hosted services.

🍾 Congratulations on your own Codespaces instance 🥳

While you wait (7 mins or so), here's what happens automatically:

- Installs required dependencies (`libssl-dev`)
- Auto-updates config files with your Codespace URLs
- Installs `npm` packages
- Starts the Tidecloak backend in Docker
- Launches the frontend dev server (Next.js)

Feel free to grab a coffee, star this project, or read about the latest breach headlines, that won't bother you when you're TideCloaked.

When the app is ready, it will self launch in a new browser tab - so make sure your browser allows pop-ups for this domain!
Otherwise, you can launch it by clicking [here](http://localhost:3000).
